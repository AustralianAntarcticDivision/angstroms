##ROMS is not a sigma coordinate system (depth layers are not spaced equally)
##s-coordinate system, different layers can be enhanced resolution in different areas

BGF - high resolution at top and bottom
- non compressibility not a problem for us probably, unless you need
sub 100m wave-breaking stuff

- curvilinear in X-Y (but this is a constant, only the layer depths is changeable)

non-hydrostatic, incompressible (though Sasha has some compressibility models)

## first experiment you should do is set up a test to see that terrain following model
## does not generate currents due only to the layer compression

./oceanS < ROMS/External/ocean_seamount.in > roms.out


mct model coupling toolkit

Compilers/ makefile looks in here to see what paths are set, can export these if needed

ROMS/ ignore Adjoint,Represent,Tangent
interested in Include/seamount.h  - cpp definitions tell ROMS which options
cppdefs.h contains master defs of all these options

ROMS ideal for idealized analytic applications

ROMS/Nonlinear/prsgrd32.h  - see oneFifth if set to 0, becomes same as something something
- can edit these things, no need to make clean - can just make again


## John Hunter's under ice example under steep calving front
closed boundaries, some flux at air-sea interface
relaxing down to some winter time condition

ice melt equations at otherwise fixed boundary with ice
- position of ice draft is constant


most of ROMS/External/ don't work out of the box

riverplume has options to add mass at certain grid cell
iceshelf ones "cliff", "2dtoy", 3d, icetest etc.

we do one of the toy ones

ROMS/External/ocean_iceshelf3d_toy.in
10*20, 13 levels
designed to run in parallel

matching header is (C preprocessor defs) (again cppdefs for glossary of terms)
Include/iceshelf3d_toy.h

ANA_
 analytical options

Functionals/ana_  etc.

ana_grid.h
if ICESHELF3D_TOY defined
 certain options are given

sets zice - depth of ice at furthest south, so it's idealized

edit Nonlinear/prsgrd32.h    OneFifth (delete the 0.0 option thing) ## ICESHELF_MORPH
make -f makefile_bkgf_nci  -j 4


./oceanS < ROMS/External/ocean_iceshelf3d_toy.in > roms.out

## 1. what ROMS wants as input files

ocean_tisom.in
ocean_amery.in

GRDNAME etc. input netcdf files

#if ANA_ is undef, then model goes looking for these input netcdf files

   GRD grid name
   BRY boundary name
   INI ini name


   rst is restart file, be sure to change the rst name after a crash
   his name


   myroms.org input_NetcDF_files

   
   BRY lateral boundaries

amery 
   temp_east (along the northern boundary)
   zice - thickness of ice
   masks
   grid angle
   pm / pm reciprocal of dx/dy

   varinfo.dat prescribes the order of input netcdf files
   separated by \ but can have split fields (i.e. yearly files) with |
   
   
## 2. how we create the files

       there are pre and post processing tools, but not useful in ice-specific scenario

   katabatic /ds/projects/tomp/totten/ana/dgwyther/netcdf/tisom008/sbc/read_tamura_daily.m

   
       surface boundary conditions

   lateral boundary conditions

   
## 3. options
